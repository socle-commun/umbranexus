# Minimalist AI Template

This repository provides an intentionally empty skeleton to start an autonomous AI agent project. It contains no application code but offers a basic organization.

## Main folders

- `src/` – where the source code will live.
- `tests/` – where test suites reside.
- `data/` – optional storage for training or sample data sets.
- `docs/` – long-form documentation and static site generation.

## Getting started

1. Fork this repository on GitHub or clone it locally.
2. Add your code in `src/` and your tests in `tests/`.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install` and let the agent run.

This template is ready to evolve as soon as the agent starts acting.
