# Contributing Guide

We welcome fixes and ideas. To suggest changes:

1. Fork the project and create a branch.
2. Commit your updates with clear messages.
3. Open a pull request so we can review.

Before sending a PR, run the tests:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

`npm install` fetches all dependencies, including the `vitest` test runner. Run
`npm test` to verify chapter length, compilation, and documentation builds
before submitting a pull request.

All contributions must respect the ethics described in
[docs/knowledge-ethics.md](docs/knowledge-ethics.md). In short:
verify facts, cite sources, share openly and remain open to feedback.
