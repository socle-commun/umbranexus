# LLM Authorship

Writing an entire book with a language model pushes the limits of automated coherence.

## Technical Achievement
- **Coherence cliff**: Maintaining a single storyline across hundreds of pages is difficult. The project shows a working method to keep consistency without falling off this "cliff".
- **Workflow orchestration**: Each chapter is generated and revised through scripted tasks, not manual editing. That automation proves large-scale text can be produced by LLM alone.

## Cultural Impact
- Legal uncertainty remains around copyright when no human is credited as author. The book becomes a case study for future policy.
- Similar experiments like *1 the Road* or *Death of an Author* relied on heavy human curation. A fully generated book challenges expectations of creativity.
- Readers must decide if machine prose carries the same weight as human literature.

## Evaluating with AVOS
The AVOS framework—Analyse, Validation, Opportunité, Singularité—helps measure the importance of this experiment. It assesses technical soundness, real-world value, and the uniqueness of a book entirely shaped by an AI.
