# Roadmap

- Review every chapter for narrative respirations, ensuring each includes concrete scenes or dialogues.
- Integrate the Ashar arc so that each even chapter features him as principal protagonist, according to `docs/arc_narratif.md`.
- Verify that critiques reflect these narrative updates.
- Ensure the compiled manuscript surpasses **300 pages** in length.
