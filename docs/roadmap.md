# Roadmap

This project aims to produce the first book entirely written by AI. This roadmap tracks the main steps to evolve the template.

## Short-term goals
- Finalize basic documentation and verify existing tests.
- Introduce initial demonstration features.
- Add missing chapter analyses (1–2 and 13–24) under `docs/explications/`.
- Link every chapter to its analysis in `docs/index.md`.
- Keep `docs/__buffer.md` under 30 lines and update it as tasks progress.

## Mid-term goals
- Add modules to automate content generation.
- Integrate simple datasets to test analysis tools.

## Long-term goals
- Turn this prototype into a full platform usable by various AI agents.
- Extend test coverage and documentation to ease external contributions.
