# Roadmap

This project aims to produce the first book entirely written by AI. This roadmap tracks the main steps to evolve the template.

## Short-term goals
- Finalize basic documentation and verify existing tests.
- Introduce initial demonstration features.
- Verify that the analysis for chapter 10 under `docs/explications/` is complete.
- Link every chapter to its analysis in `docs/index.md`.
- Generate the index with `npm run index` to update `docs/index.json` and the summaries under `docs/summaries/`.
- Summaries allow agents to load only the relevant sections when editing chapters.
- Review and edit final chapters for coherence.
- Prepare a release candidate compiling all chapters.

## Mid-term goals
- Add modules to automate content generation.
- Integrate simple datasets to test analysis tools.

## Long-term goals
- Turn this prototype into a full platform usable by various AI agents.
- Ensure the compiled manuscript surpasses **300 pages** in length.
- Extend test coverage and documentation to ease external contributions.
