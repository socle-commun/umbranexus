# Alchemy Rediscovered and Restored (1941)

By Archibald Cockren

This text explores the history and theoretical underpinnings of alchemy, presenting it not merely as a pursuit of transmuting base metals into gold, but as a profound philosophical and spiritual science.

## Part I: Historical

### Beginnings of Alchemy
Alchemy's origins are traced back to ancient China and Egypt, with figures like Chang Tao-Ling and Hermes Trismegistus. The author emphasizes that alchemy was a serious pursuit for cultured individuals, not just eccentric old men. The famous Smaragdine Table of Hermes is presented as a foundational text, highlighting the unity of matter and the concept of "as above, so below."

### Early European Alchemists
The text discusses key European alchemists such as Artephius, Albertus Magnus, and Raymond Lully, detailing their contributions and the challenges they faced, including persecution by religious authorities. The widespread practice of alchemy in the 13th and 14th centuries is noted, alongside the rise of charlatans that led to its disrepute.

### The Story of Nicholas Flamel
A detailed account of Nicholas Flamel's life and his discovery of the "gilded book" by Abraham the Jew is provided. Flamel's journey to understand the book's allegorical content, his wife Peronelle's involvement, and their eventual success in transmuting metals are narrated. The author asserts the veracity of Flamel's story, particularly his description of the "strong odour" associated with the First Matter.

### Basil Valentine
Basil Valentine, a Benedictine monk, is presented as a significant figure in both alchemy and early chemistry. His practical discoveries, such as the preparation of hydrochloric acid and the extraction of copper, are highlighted. The text also includes a critical excerpt from Valentine's "Triumphal Chariot of Antimony," where he criticizes the ignorance of contemporary medical practitioners.

### Paracelsus
The life and work of Paracelsus (Aureolus Phillipus Theophrastur Bobastur von Hohenheim) are explored. His early studies in alchemy, medicine, and surgery, his nomadic life, and his controversial methods are discussed. Paracelsus's emphasis on mineral medicines and his challenge to established medical systems are noted.

### Alchemy in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries
This section covers figures like Jean Baptista van Helmont, who, influenced by Paracelsus, focused on the chemical preparation of medicine. The account of Butler, an Irish gentleman who performed cures using Hermetic medicine, and Denys Zachare's pursuit of the Philosopher's Stone are included. The testimony of John Frederick Helvetius regarding a transmutation performed by the "Artist Elias" is also detailed, along with other instances of successful transmutations. English alchemists like Roger Bacon, Sir George Ripley, and Edward Kelly are also mentioned, highlighting their contributions and the challenges they faced.

### The Comte de St. Germain
The enigmatic Comte de St. Germain is presented as an expert in the alchemical art, known for his longevity and ability to transmute metals. Casanova's and Marquis de Valbelle's testimonies of St. Germain's alchemical feats are recounted. The author connects St. Germain's knowledge to his sojourns in Asia and emphasizes the physical reality of alchemical processes.

## Part II: Theoretical

### The Seed of Metals
This section delves into the theoretical aspects of alchemy, aiming to clarify its "jargon" and demonstrate its scientific truth. The author explains that alchemy views chemistry, occultism, and religion as interconnected. The core axiom is that all manifestation proceeds from "One Thing," the "Seed" or "Alkahest," which gives rise to Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt. These are not to be confused with their common names but represent the Spirit, Soul, and Body of metals. The planetary influences on metals (Gold-Sun, Silver-Moon, etc.) are also discussed, along with the alchemical belief that all metals are progressing towards becoming gold.

### The Spirit of Mercury
The "Spirit of Mercury" is described as the volatile essence of metal, an Aether in its gaseous state. Basilius Valentinus's writings are quoted to explain that all visible and tangible things are made from this Spirit of Mercury. It is considered the "Master-Key" for operating on metals, capable of resolving them into their first matter and even renewing human age. The text emphasizes that this "Celestial Water" is the beginning, oil, and means of the alchemical process, burning not because it is made of spiritual Sulphur.
