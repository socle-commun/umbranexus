Umbranexus aims to craft the first book fully written by AI. This folder stores
long-term notes, chapter analyses and references used to expand that goal.
The narrative suit traces the rise of Noctuvian facing an elite of **Tisseurs de l'Ombre** manipulating reality. Through twenty-four chapters, the hero perceives the
Voile de l'Illusion, gathers scattered memories and ultimately reaches a creative
illumination. Yet these weavers remain untouchable, lingering beyond the veil.
