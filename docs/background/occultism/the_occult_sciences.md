# The Occult Sciences: A Compendium of Transcendental Doctrine and Experiment (1891)

By Arthur Edward Waite

This extensive work explores various facets of occultism, presenting them as transcendental sciences rooted in ancient traditions and practices. It aims to distinguish between genuine mystical knowledge and fraudulent interpretations, offering a comprehensive overview of magical practices, secret sciences, and modern spiritual phenomena.

## Introduction

The introduction posits that Hermetic philosophy offers a real and realizable knowledge of invisible worlds and the latent potentialities within humanity. It argues that successful psychic experiments of the past can be replicated, and that true magic is a science, not mere superstition. The author emphasizes the need to differentiate between genuine Hermetic truth and the charlatanry that has historically surrounded it. He also discusses the philosophical distinction between spirit and matter, suggesting that both are manifestations of a single, ultimately unknown substance.

## Part I: Magical Practices

### Magic: Definitions
Magic is broadly defined as the art of producing effects by seemingly inadequate means or evoking spirits. It is presented as the synthesis of ancient sciences possessed by the Magi of India, Persia, Chaldea, and Egypt. The text distinguishes between four classes of spirits: Angels, Devils (Demons), Elementary Spirits (Sylphs, Undines, Gnomes, Salamanders), and Souls of the Dead. It also differentiates between White Magic (lawful application of arcane forces) and Black Magic (lawless and vicious application).

### White Magic: The Evocation of Angels
This section delves into angelology, particularly the Kabbalistic hierarchy of angels derived from the Hebrew alphabet. It details the attributes and functions of various angelic orders (Seraphim, Ophanim, Aralym, Hasmalim, Powers, Virtues, Principalities, Bene-Elohim, Cherubim, Issim) and their correspondence with divine names and planetary influences. It also introduces the Seven Celestial Stewards (Arathron, Bethor, Phaleg, Och, Hagith, Ophiel, Phul) and their respective powers and domains. The text outlines the preparations and rituals for angelic evocations, emphasizing purity, contemplation, and adherence to divine will.

### White Magic: The Evocation of the Spirits of the Elements
This part explores the doctrine of Elementary Spirits (Sylphs of Air, Undines of Water, Gnomes of Earth, Salamanders of Fire). It discusses their natures, their potential for interaction with humans (including the possibility of gaining immortality through union with humans), and the methods for dominating them. The text describes rituals for exorcising air, water, fire, and earth, involving sufflation, sprinkling, burning perfumes, and tracing magical figures like the Star of Solomon and the Pentagram. It stresses the importance of overcoming one's own weaknesses to command these spirits.

### Black Magic: The Evocation of Demons
This section addresses the controversial topic of demon evocation. It acknowledges that a significant portion of historical magic involved communication with demons for unlawful purposes. It presents a hierarchical classification of infernal spirits (e.g., Beelzebub, Satan, Euronymus, Moloch, Pluto, Leonard, Baalberith, Proserpine, Adramaleck, Astaroth, Nergal, Baal, Leviathan, Belphegor, Mammon, Belial, Rimmon, Thamuz, Hutgin, Martinet, Lucifer, Alastor, Verdelet, Succor-Benoth, Chamos, Melchom, Misroch, Behemoth, Dagon, Mullin, Kobal, Asmodeus, Nybbas, Antichrist) and their respective powers. The text describes the elaborate and often grotesque rituals involved in demon evocation, including the use of a "Blasting Rod" and the formation of pacts. It critiques the futility and moral reprehensibility of Black Magic, noting that its practitioners often sought material gain rather than true spiritual power.

### Necromancy: The Evocation of the Souls of the Dead
Necromancy is defined as the art of communicating with the dead to discern future events or gain knowledge. The text distinguishes between lawful necromancy, which aims for spiritual exaltation and communication with beatified souls, and black necromancy, which involves unhallowed practices and communion with evil spirits. It provides a detailed ceremonial for legitimate necromantic evocation, including the preparation of an oratory, specific attire, and the use of symbolic objects like a portrait of the deceased, an altar, and a single taper. The ritual emphasizes purity of intention, abstinence, and prayer, aiming for a conscious communication with the ethereal substance of the departed soul.

## Part II: Secret Sciences in Connection with Magic

### Alchemy
Alchemy is presented as the science of transmuting metals, but also as a spiritual process for the perfection of man. It discusses the alchemical theory of metallic generation from Mercury and Sulphur, and the concept of the Philosopher's Stone as an elixir for both metals and human beings. The author acknowledges the historical evidence for transmutations but also highlights the allegorical and often obscure nature of alchemical texts, which were designed to conceal true knowledge from the uninitiated. He suggests that the ultimate goal of alchemy was the spiritual transformation of man.

### The Elixir of Life
This section explores the concept of the Elixir of Life, or Universal Medicine, as a means to achieve physical immortality and rejuvenate the human body. It cites historical claims of rejuvenation and provides a recipe attributed to Trithemius. The text also touches upon the idea of the Elixir as a spiritual substance, capable of transforming the soul.

### Crystallomancy
Crystallomancy is presented as a method of divination through the contemplation of a crystal, leading to hypnotic states and clairvoyant visions. It describes the preparation of the crystal and the subject, emphasizing the role of imagination and will in eliciting supernatural revelations. The author notes that this is one of the most innocent and successful minor magical practices.

### The Composition of Talismans
Talismans are defined as objects imbued with occult force through the operator's will and planetary influences. The text discusses the famous Seal of Solomon and the five-pointed star as powerful talismans. It details the composition and consecration of talismans for each of the seven planets (Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn), specifying the appropriate metals, symbols, and rituals. It also mentions the existence of black talismans, which are infused with malevolent will.

It discusses its historical use, the belief in its magnetic properties, and the various theories surrounding its efficacy. The text provides anecdotes of successful dowsing and notes its connection to animal magnetism and psychometry.

## Part III: Professors of Magical Art

### The Mystics
This part defines mysticism as the endeavor to grasp the divine essence and achieve communion with the Highest. It traces the history of Christian mysticism from Neo-Platonism through various figures like Dionysius the Areopagite, St. Bernard, Bonaventura, Luther, Paracelsus, Jacob Bohme, and Louis Claude de St. Martin. It emphasizes the spiritual journey of introspection and regeneration, aiming for a conscious life in God.

It discusses the symbolism of the Rose-Cross and its connection to Martin Luther. The author critically examines the claims of the Rosicrucians, noting discrepancies in their historical accounts and the eventual decline of the movement. He suggests that the Rosicrucian Society of 1614 was likely a development of an earlier obscure sect established by Simon Studion.

### The Freemasons
This part explores the connection between Freemasonry and mysticism. It distinguishes between ancient Craft Masonry and the more modern symbolic form, asserting that the latter originated in mysticism. It discusses various theories of Masonic origin, linking it to ancient mysteries (Eleusinian, Bacchus), the Jewish Essenes, the Knights Templars, and the Dionysian artificers. The text highlights the shared principles of moral perfection, secrecy, and symbolic instruction between Freemasonry and earlier mystical traditions. It also notes the significant influence of magic, alchemy, and figures like Cagliostro, Baron Tschoudy, and Mesmer on symbolic Freemasonry in France and Germany.

## Part IV: Modern Phenomena

### Mesmerism
Mesmerism is presented as a modern manifestation of ancient magical practices, particularly those involving the induction of hypnotic states for healing and spiritual communication. It traces the historical roots of animal magnetism to ancient Egypt and the practices of Paracelsus. The text describes the therapeutic effects of mesmerism, including pain relief and healing, and discusses the various phenomena associated with it, such as clairvoyance, clairaudience, psychometry, and the development of new personalities. It also touches upon the dangers and ethical considerations of hypnotic experiments.

### Modern Spiritualism
This section examines Modern Spiritualism as a contemporary form of necromancy, focusing on communication with the souls of the dead. It compares Spiritualism's methods and phenomena to those of ancient magic, noting the simplification of rituals. It outlines the conditions for successful seances, including the presence of a medium, harmony among participants, and appropriate atmospheric conditions. The text describes various spiritualistic phenomena, such as raps, movement of objects, levitation, materialization, automatic writing, direct writing, and spirit photography. It also discusses the challenges of fraud and the importance of genuine mediumship.

### Theosophy
Theosophy is presented as a modern spiritual gnosis that claims to be a complete system of arcane knowledge, derived from ancient Eastern traditions. It is described as a synthesis of universal mysticism, encompassing principles from Buddhism, Christianity, and other religions. The text discusses the Theosophical Society, founded by Madame Blavatsky and Colonel Olcott, and their role in disseminating this knowledge to the Western world. It outlines the Theosophical understanding of human constitution (seven principles), the destiny of man (reincarnation), and the path to spiritual attainment through asceticism and contemplation. It emphasizes that Theosophy is not a new religion but a re-veiling of the ancient Wisdom Religion, offering a scientific approach to spiritual truths.
