*   **World-building:** This text contributes to the historical and cultural background of occult beliefs, offering a realistic portrayal of how such beliefs manifest in society and how they are challenged by evolving thought. It can inform the depiction of factions or historical events within the Umbranexus related to the suppression or manipulation of power.
