# The Mirror of Alchemy (1597)

By Roger Bacon

This treatise, attributed to Roger Bacon, provides a foundational understanding of alchemy, its principles, and the practical steps involved in the creation of the Philosopher's Stone. It emphasizes the natural processes that alchemy seeks to imitate and perfect.

## Of the Science of Alchemy

Alchemy is defined as a corporal science that, through natural conjunction and knowledge, transforms metals into a more perfect kind. It aims to create an Elixir that perfects imperfect metals upon projection.

## Of the Natural Principles and Procreation of Minerals

All metals and minerals are begotten from two natural principles: Argent-vive (Mercury) and Sulphur. Nature constantly strives for the perfection of Gold. The purity and impurity of these two principles determine the quality of metals like Gold, Silver, Steel, Lead, Copper, and Iron. Gold is considered a perfect body, while others are imperfect due to deficiencies in fixation, color, or weight.

## Of What Things the Matter of Elixir Must Be Extracted

The matter for the Elixir must be chosen from a commixtion of Argent-vive and Sulphur. The author stresses that the Art is not found in living creatures or vegetables, but in minerals. The ideal matter is one where Argent-vive and Sulphur are already proportioned and congealed, allowing artificial fire to bring it to perfection.

## Of the Manner of Working, and of Moderating and Continuing the Fire

Alchemy imitates nature's continuous concoction process, as seen in mines where heat transforms gross water into Argent-vive and fatness of earth into Sulphur. The fire used in the alchemical process must be gentle and continuous, gradually increasing, to avoid loss.

## Of the Quality of the Vessel and Furnace

The vessel should be round, made of glass or earth, with a sealed neck, mimicking the enclosed environment of mountains where metals are naturally formed. The heat should not directly touch the matter but be temperate and evenly distributed.

## Of the Accidental and Essential Colours Appearing in the Work

The process of decoction reveals various colors, each signifying a stage in the transformation. These include black (putrefaction), red (imperfect), green (soul's dominion), peacock's tail (all colors before whiteness), white (purity), and finally, true red (perfection).

## How to Make Projection of the Medicine Upon Any Imperfect Body

The red Elixir transmutes all metals into pure gold, and the white Elixir whitens them. The closer a metal is to perfection, the easier and more perfectly it is reduced. The principle of "like rejoices in his like" is crucial, meaning the soul quickly enters its own body, and spiritual things become corporeal, and vice-versa.

## The Smaragdine Table of Hermes Trismegistus

This foundational text of alchemy states: "That which is beneath is like that which is above; & that which is above, is like that which is beneath, to work the miracles of one thing." It describes the process of separation (earth from fire, thin from thick), ascension from earth to heaven, and descent back to earth, leading to the glory of the whole world and the overcoming of all subtle and solid things.

## A Brief Commentary of Hortulanus upon the Smaragdine Table of Hermes

Hortulanus provides a commentary on the Emerald Table, emphasizing the division of the Stone into two parts (superior and inferior), the role of the Sun and Moon as father and mother, and the wind (soul) carrying the Stone. He explains that the Stone is perfect when its soul is fixed in the body, and that purification and separation of elements are necessary for multiplication.

## The Book of the Secrets of Alchemy, Composed by Kalid

Kalid's work discusses the four masteries of alchemy: solution, congelation, whitening, and reddening. He explains that solution and congelation are intertwined, and that the spirit will not dwell with the body until the body is made subtle. The text also describes the necessary instruments (Aludel, Cucurbit) and the nature of the Stone, which is found everywhere but is vile, black, and stinking, yet holds immense power to cure diseases and transmute bodies.
