Translated from Ancient Manuscripts in The British Museum, London.
By S. Liddell MacGregor Mathers

This text, a foundational work in Qabalistical and Ceremonial Magic, provides a detailed exposition of King Solomon's secret procedures, including mysteries, magic rites, original plates, seals, charms, and talismans. It emphasizes the importance of divine love, planetary influences, and precise rituals for magical operations.

## Preface

The editor notes that this electronic edition is based on the 1916 American edition, with irrelevant interjections and footnotes removed. It highlights the historical significance of the "Key of Solomon" as a primary source for ceremonial magic, valued by occult writers like Eliphas Levi. The preface also cautions against works of Black Magic and the use of blood in rituals, stressing that prayer, pentacles, and perfumes are sufficient. It addresses the challenges of transcribing Hebrew words and characters in the original manuscripts.

## Introduction

The introduction presents the origin story of the "Key of Solomon" through the narrative of King Solomon and his son Roboam. Solomon recounts receiving divine wisdom from the Angel Homadiel, which granted him knowledge of all living things. He composed this "Key" to preserve hidden secrets of magical arts, emphasizing that it alone can unlock this knowledge. The text describes how the "Key" was hidden in an ivory casket in Solomon's sepulchre and later discovered by Babylonian Philosophers. The Angel of the Lord reveals the purpose of the obscurity in the text: to prevent it from falling into the hands of the wicked. The importance of using this wisdom for good and with discipline is stressed.

## Preliminary Discourse

This section reiterates that Solomon's wisdom was divinely inspired and passed down to his son Roboam. It explains that the "Testament," known as "The Clavicle, or Key of Solomon," was engraved on tree bark and pentacles on copper plates for preservation in the Temple. The text's translation history from Hebrew to Latin and then to the vulgar tongue is also mentioned.

## Chapter I: Concerning The Divine Love Which Precedes the Acquisition of This Knowledge

This chapter emphasizes that the foundation of acquiring magical knowledge is the fear and adoration of God, and invoking Him in all undertakings. It states that observing the order of hours, days, and the position of the Moon is crucial for successful magical operations.

## Chapter II: Of The Days, And Hours, And Of The Virtues Of The Planets

This chapter details the planetary rulership over the hours of the day and night. Each of the seven planets (Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon) governs specific hours and days, and their virtues influence the outcome of magical experiments.

- **Saturn:** Good for summoning souls of those who died naturally, influencing buildings, business, acquiring learning, destruction, death, hatred, and discord.
- **Jupiter:** Proper for obtaining honors, acquiring riches, contracting friendships, preserving health, and achieving desires.
- **Mars:** Suitable for experiments regarding war, military honor, courage, overthrowing enemies, ruin, slaughter, cruelty, discord, wounding, and death.
- **Sun:** Very good for temporal wealth, hope, gain, fortune, divination, favor of princes, dissolving hostile feelings, and making friends.
- **Venus:** Good for forming friendships, kindness, love, joyous undertakings, and traveling.
- **Mercury:** Good for eloquence, intelligence, promptitude in business, science, divination, wonders, apparitions, answers regarding the future, thefts, writings, deceit, and merchandise.
- **Moon:** Good for embassies, voyages, envoys, messages, navigation, reconciliation, love, and acquiring merchandise by water.

The chapter also provides specific lunar conditions for different types of operations (terrestrial, fiery, watery, airy signs) and warns against commencing operations during the Moon's conjunction with the Sun.

## Chapter III: Concerning the Arts

This chapter outlines the two types of magical experiments: those performed without a Circle and those requiring one. It details the preparations for the Master and Disciples, including abstinence, purification rituals (bathing in consecrated water), and specific prayers. The construction of the Magic Circle is described, including the placement of divine names (IHVH, AHIH, ALIVN, ALH, AL, IH, AGLA, ADNI) and the use of magical instruments. The Master's role in encouraging disciples and performing conjurations is also explained.

## Chapter IV: The Confession to be Made by the Exorcist

This chapter provides a detailed confession for the exorcist, acknowledging sins of pride, avarice, gluttony, debauchery, sacrilege, theft, violence, and various other transgressions. The confession emphasizes humility and a plea for divine mercy and wisdom to understand hidden truths and perform the magical work righteously.

## Chapter V: Prayer and Conjurations

This chapter continues with prayers and conjurations, invoking God's power and mercy to facilitate the appearance of spirits and the accomplishment of desires. It stresses that these ceremonies are not to tempt God but to gain knowledge of hidden things.
