# The Most Holy Trinosophia - Comte De St. Germain

This text, attributed to the enigmatic Comte de St.-Germain, is a profound Hermetic and alchemical manuscript. It is presented as a guide to sublime sciences and a testament to the author's experiences with occult knowledge and spiritual initiation.

## Introduction: The Man Who Does Not Die

This section introduces the Comte de St.-Germain as a baffling and mysterious figure of modern history, known for his noble birth, vast knowledge, linguistic proficiency, and apparent longevity. It recounts anecdotes of his appearances across Europe, his artistic and scientific talents (including gem purification and painting), and his uncanny historical knowledge. The text also touches upon his peculiar dietary habits and the skepticism he faced, while asserting the authenticity of his alchemical feats, such as the transmutation of metals. It refutes claims of him being a charlatan, emphasizing his integrity and the respect he commanded from European nobility and intellectuals. His connection to Rosicrucianism, Freemasonry, and his prophetic warnings about the French Revolution are also highlighted.

## The Rarest of Occult Manuscripts

This part describes "La Très Sainte Trinosophia" as a unique and highly significant occult manuscript, possibly the only known mystical writing by St.-Germain. It details the manuscript's physical characteristics: 96 leaves, excellent calligraphy, and embellishments with figures and symbols. It mentions the presence of various ancient languages (Chaldean Hebrew, Ionic Greek, Arabic, Syriac, cuneiform) and hieroglyphics, suggesting a complex coded system. The history of the manuscript, including its possession by Cagliostro and its eventual acquisition by the Bibliothèque de Troyes, is recounted. The title "Trinosophia" is interpreted as "three-fold wisdom," implying that the text's meaning requires three keys: alchemy (soul-chemistry), Essenian Cabbalism, and Alexandrian Hermetism. The section also discusses the efforts to decode the manuscript's complex ciphers and its connection to Masonic symbolism, particularly the Lodge of Les Trinosophists.

## Parallel French and English Text of The Most Holy Trinosophia

### Section One

The author, writing from an Inquisition dungeon, addresses his friend Philochatus, sharing his profound knowledge and the dangers of misusing divine power and indiscretion. He recounts his past happiness, immense power, and subsequent fall due to speaking out, leading to his imprisonment and torture. Despite his suffering, he expresses gratitude for divine justice and foresees his release and purification within two years, after which he will resume his glorious station. He warns Philochatus to learn from his misfortunes and to guard the secrets revealed in the manuscript, emphasizing that even a single misinterpreted line could prevent understanding.

### Section Two

This section describes a mystical journey. The narrator, guided by a star, enters a volcanic landscape (Solfatara), places a golden bough on an iron altar, and pronounces formidable words. The earth trembles, Vesuvius roars, and celestial spirits praise the Creator. He is enveloped in smoke and darkness, then finds himself in a vast underground cavern. He dons a white linen robe, takes a copper lamp, and navigates through narrow, black marble passages. He encounters four colored doors (black, red, blue, white) at cardinal points. The crystal star guides him through the white door, leading him to the next stage of his initiation.

### Section Three

The journey continues with the narrator facing a strong wind and a vast expanse of water. He plunges into the waves, guided by an invisible hand that places his lamp on his head. He struggles to reach the opposite shore, feeling his strength wane, but is renewed by a sudden surge of energy. He encounters a richly dressed man (a monarch) in a boat, who offers guidance, but the narrator refuses, stating his trust in God. The boat and monarch vanish, and the narrator finds himself on a green sand shore before a silver wall with two red marble panels. One panel bears sacred script, the other Greek letters. Two lions guard a golden crown. These emblems disappear, signifying the completion of this stage.

### Section Four

The narrator enters a lake of fire, walking unharmed through flaming sulphur and bitumen. He arrives at a circular hall adorned with forty columns of fire, some white and vivid, others shadowed by blackish flames. In the center stands a serpent-shaped altar of greenish gold with ruby eyes, bearing a silvery inscription. A sword is planted near it, and a cup rests on the serpent's head. A celestial choir and a voice command him to strike the serpent with the sword. He obeys, and the altar and columns vanish. A hand lifts him through the vault, and shadowy phantoms (Hydras, Lamias, serpents) appear but are dispelled by the sword. He ascends through layers of the globe, finally reaching the light of day.

### Section Five

Upon reaching the earth's surface, the narrator is swiftly carried through the air by his invisible guide, witnessing globes and earths revolving below. He loses consciousness and awakens on a luxurious cushion, surrounded by fragrant flowers. His linen garment is replaced by a blue robe spangled with golden stars. He sees a yellow altar with a pure flame, bearing black engraved characters. A shining torch and a bird with black feet, a silvery body, a red head, black wings, and a golden neck are present. The bird, which can only fly in flames, holds a green branch. The altar, bird, and torch symbolize all things, representing the essence of creation. Four inscriptions surround these emblems, hinting at deeper meanings.
