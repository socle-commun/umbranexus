# A Dweller On Two Planets Or, The Dividing Of The Way By Phylos The Thibetan (1905)

**Source:** `A Dweller On Two Planets Or, The Dividing Of The Way By Phylos The Thibetan(1905).txt`

This book is presented as an "absolute revelation" dictated by an "occult adept" named Phylos the Thibetan (Frederick S. Oliver). Phylos claims to have lived in Atlantis (referred to as Poseid) twelve thousand years ago and also in the United States.

## Key Themes and Concepts:

*   **Atlantis (Poseid):** The book provides a detailed account of Atlantean history, society, and advanced technology.
    *   **Political Structure:** A limited monarchy with an elective emperor and a "Council of Ninety" (Princes of the Realm).
    *   **Social Divisions:** Two major branches: "Incala" (priesthood) and "Xioqua" (scientists). Education was highly valued, and diplomas were required for political office.
    *   **Advanced Technology:** Atlanteans possessed deep knowledge of electrical energies, including "Night-Side of Nature" forces, high-grade explosives, and advanced transit systems. They had technologies akin to X-rays and wireless telegraphy, which are presented as rediscoveries in the modern era.
    *   **Karma and Reincarnation:** The book emphasizes the concept of Karma and reincarnation, suggesting that individuals return to Earth to experience the consequences of their past actions.
    *   **Prophecies:** It includes prophecies about the end of an age, a coming conflict, and the eventual return of Atlantean knowledge and a more spiritual era.
*   **Spiritual and Occult Elements:**
    *   **Incal:** The Atlantean concept of God, described as "immanent in Nature." The philosophy states, "To know God is to know all worlds." This panthéistic view underpins their understanding of natural and spiritual laws.
    *   **Substance Unique et Énergie Unique:** The fundamental principle of the universe, where all matter and phenomena are manifestations of a single underlying substance and energy. This energy is vibratory, with different vibration rates leading to various forms (sound, heat, light, electricity, vital/psychic force).
    *   **Le Côté Nuit de la Nature (Navaz):** A realm where duality is fully manifested (cold vs. heat, darkness vs. light, positive vs. negative polarity). It is associated with forces like "repulsion by levitation" and is accessible to occult adepts.
    *   The author (Phylos) is an "occult adept" who communicates through "mental talks" and clairvoyance/clairaudience.
    *   The book touches upon the idea of a "Divine stream of Life" and the "Living Cross" as symbols of spiritual power and sacrifice.
    *   **Adeptes Occultes / Magiens:** Individuals who have gained a profound understanding of natural laws and can manipulate the forces of nature, performing seemingly "magical" feats. They are often described as part of a "sublime brotherhood."
    *   **Mont Shasta:** A significant spiritual location where the author received dictations from Phylos, symbolizing a deep connection with the natural world and spiritual forces.
*   **Humanity and Society:**
    *   Critique of human selfishness, greed, and violence as causes of societal woes.
    *   **Socialisme et Paternalisme en Atlantide:** The Atlantean government is depicted as a paternalistic system where the state owned all land, public transport, and communications. It provided for its citizens' needs with nominal rents and fees. This model is presented as fostering remarkable social harmony, contrasting with industrial conflicts of later eras.
    *   The idea that "Nature follows Man," implying that human actions and spiritual state influence the physical world.

## Integration into the Grimoire d'alchimie digitale:

*   **Noctuvian:** The themes of ancient wisdom, spiritual evolution, the nature of reality, and the potential for humanity to reach higher planes of existence align well with Noctuvian's lyrical and symbolic chapters. The advanced Atlantean technologies and their underlying "Night-Side" forces could inspire the magical aspects of the Umbranexus.
*   **Ashar:** The prophecies of conflict, the consequences of human depravity, and the more practical/technological aspects of Atlantean society could provide a rich background for Ashar's thriller and horrific narratives. The idea of "frauds" and hidden truths could also be explored.
*   **World-building:** This text offers a foundational mythology for the Umbranexus, suggesting a cyclical nature of history where ancient knowledge is rediscovered. It provides a framework for integrating advanced technology with spiritual and occult concepts.
